//! The runtime spine: a world of minds and a serial deterministic tick (RUNBOOK
//! section 3, design Parts 4 and 57).
//!
//! A [`World`] owns the minds, the event log, a clock, and the calibrations the minds
//! reason under. Its [`World::tick`] advances the clock and applies a batch of stimuli
//! to the minds in one canonical order: stimuli are sorted by the target mind's
//! [`StableId`] and a caller-supplied ordinal before they are applied, so the result
//! never depends on the order the batch was assembled in. The underlying belief and
//! theory-of-mind accumulators are already order-independent, so the canonical sort is
//! belt-and-braces, and it is what a later phase relies on when perception and the
//! decision loop produce stimuli in parallel.
//!
//! This is deliberately the serial tick, not the parallel command scheduler: that
//! scheduler's determinism (the total command order and the non-associative combines)
//! is still open design (R-CMD-ORDER, R-REDUCE-ORDER), so the parallel form is left for
//! that resolution. Nothing here invents a calibration value. The minds' thresholds and
//! weights are loaded from the manifest and fail loud while reserved; a development run
//! uses a clearly-labelled fixtures profile, never the authoritative manifest's unset
//! entries.
