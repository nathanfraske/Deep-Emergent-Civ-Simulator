# Owner decisions log

Decisions the owner needs to make, accumulated during autonomous work and surfaced at the end (owner
directive 2026-07-08: derive value gates and move on with dev values; leave decisions for the end, do not
stop mid-work to ask). Each entry states the decision, what I did in the interim (derived or dev-set), and
the basis, so the owner can confirm or override in one pass. This is not a blocker: work continues past every
entry using a derived or dev-set value.

## Open

1. **R-UNITS-PIN: the reserve's absolute joule scale** (the `MetabolicAnchors` energy-density-to-joule
   anchor). The edibility grounding makes intake and drain both physical in the reserve's units; the ABSOLUTE
   scale (how a floor `bio.energy_density` in kJ/g maps to the reserve's stored joules) is the one genuine
   units anchor. INTERIM: dev-set to the value that keeps the dev world viable, iterated against the
   survival proof. BASIS: the reserve stored energy is `capacity * body_mass_kg * bio.energy_density`; set so
   a being's daily intake at plausible forage density offsets its Kleiber drain. Owner sets the canonical
   value; the mechanism derives everything else.

2. **The T2/T3/T5 axis-conversion sign-off + Part 62 consolidation** (the chemistry arc, PR #105 merged).
   The mechanism is built and byte-neutral; the design-doc consolidation (a Part 62 record, the
   Decided-and-reserved blockquote, the bibliography, the audit Section 1/2/3 and counts) is the owner's
   resolution step (= R-SOURCE-VECTOR / R-BIO-REGISTRY).

3. **Cluster-I merge checkpoints.** Each Cluster-I arc branch (edibility grounding, Arc 5, 6, 7) is built
   autonomously and pushed as a PR; the owner runs final sims and merges. The chemistry arc (PR #105) was
   merged on the owner's standing authorization; later arcs are queued as PRs for owner review unless the
   owner extends the merge authorization.

4. **The genuine physics-CONSTANT reserved values** surfaced by the grounding, none fabricated: the Kleiber
   coefficient `kleiber_a`, the trophic/assimilation efficiency `ingest_efficiency`, the rock-weathering and
   per-substance decomposition kinetics. These are legitimate physics-floor authored inputs (Principle 9);
   dev-set until the owner calibrates. Not fudges.
